# Advanced Automated Sterilizing System (Arduino-Based IoT Capstone)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **2024 IoT Capstone** that focuses on developing an **Arduino-based automated sterilization system**. The system is designed to efficiently manage the complete sterilization cycle, including **sterilizing, drying, cooling, and draining**, with minimal human intervention.

By integrating sensors, relays, a servo motor, and an LCD display, the system ensures a **timed, controlled, and user-friendly sterilization process**, making it suitable for applications such as laboratories, clinics, and controlled sanitation environments.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Automate the sterilization process to reduce manual handling
- Ensure accurate timing for each sterilization stage
- Improve safety and consistency in sterilization procedures
- Provide real-time system status through an LCD interface

## ⚙️ System Features
- ⏱️ **Timed Sterilization Process**
- 🔥 **Automated Sterilizing, Drying, Cooling, and Draining Cycles**
- 🖥️ **LCD Display for Real-Time Status Updates**
- 🔁 **Servo-Controlled Mechanism**
- ⚡ **Relay-Controlled Components**
- 🌡️ **Sensor-Based Monitoring**
- 🤖 **Fully Automated Operation Using Arduino**

## 🧩 Hardware Components
- Arduino Microcontroller  
- LCD Display  
- Servo Motor  
- Relay Module  
- Sensors (temperature / liquid / timing-related)  
- Power Supply  
- Connecting Wires & Breadboard  

## 🧠 How the System Works
1. **Initialization** – System powers on and initializes all components.
2. **Sterilization Phase** – Relays activate sterilizing components for a set duration.
3. **Drying Phase** – Moisture is removed using controlled timing.
4. **Cooling Phase** – System allows safe cooldown before proceeding.
5. **Draining Phase** – Servo and relays manage liquid drainage.
6. **Completion** – LCD displays process completion status.

Each phase runs automatically based on programmed timing and sensor feedback.
